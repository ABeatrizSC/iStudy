# What is iStudy?
iStudy is a web platform designed to help students efficiently organize, manage, and track their study habits. Among its many features are:

- User registration and login;
- Management of subjects and their topics;
- Study tracking, based on registered subjects and topics;
- Study games, such as flashcards and quizzes to reinforce learning;
- Time management tools (Stopwatch and Pomodoro timer);
- Schedule and reminder management;
- Dashboards with metrics of study hours per subject, topic, and category (daily, weekly, and monthly).

</br>

# Project Structure
- `istudy-app`: This folder contains the front-end code of the application, built with TypeScript, React.Js and NextJS.
- `istudy-services`: This folder contains the system's back-end (Java/Spring Boot), which follows a microservices architecture using Spring Cloud API Gateway as a request interceptor and Spring Cloud Netflix (Eureka) for service registration and discovery.

![istudy_architecture.png](docs%2Fimages%2Fistudy_architecture.png)
(Preliminary draft of the system architecture. Some inaccuracies may be present as I am still in the learning and understanding phase.)

# Technologies Used

At the moment, these are the technologies used:

## Back-End
* **Java**: A high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for building server-side applications, web services, and Android applications.

* **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing built-in features for dependency injection, configuration, and microservices support.

* **Spring Security**: A powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications.

* **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Open standard that allows secure transmission of authentication information.

* **Spring Cloud API Gateway**: Serves as the central entry point, handling request routing, authentication, and traffic control between microservices.

* **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**: Enables automatic registration and discovery of microservices, facilitating dynamic scaling and seamless communication.

* **RabbitMQ**: An open-source software that acts as a message broker, or middleman, between producers and consumers of messages.

* **JPA**: The Java Persistence API, a specification that provides object-relational mapping (ORM) to manage relational data in Java applications.

* **MapStruct**: A Java mapping framework that simplifies object-to-object mapping, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.

* **Flyway**: A database migration tool that ensures version control and consistency across database schema changes.

* **Lombok**: A Java library that reduces boilerplate code by generating common methods like getters, setters, constructors, and more through annotations.

* **Postman**: A tool used for API testing and development, enabling users to send HTTP requests, inspect responses, and automate API tests.

## Front-End
* **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making code easier to read, debug, and maintain.

* **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on creating reusable UI components and managing the view layer in web applications.

* **NextJS**: Next. js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and static rendering.

* **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid UI development using predefined classes.

* **Material UI (MUI)**: MUI is a massive library of UI components designers and developers can use to build React applications.

* **Tanstack/React Query**: A powerful data-fetching and state management library for React, ideal for managing server state with features like caching, background updates, and retries.

* **JWT Decode**: A small library that decodes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) without verifying their signature.

* **Lucide React**: A React library that provides access to Lucideâ€™s beautiful and consistent set of SVG icons.

* **React Toastify**: A React library for showing toast notifications in a simple and customizable way.

* **Formik**: A form management library for React that simplifies form handling, validation, and submission.

* **Yup**:  A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation, often used with Formik for form validation.

* **DayJs**: A lightweight JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

* **Swiper js**: A powerful, free, and open-source JavaScript library for creating modern, touch-friendly sliders and carousels.

* **React card flip**: A specific library or component that allows you to create a card that animates to reveal content on its back when clicked or interacted withxt.

* **React calendar**: A lightweight and easily configurable calendar component.

## Databases and other technologies
* **Docker**: A platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight containers, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying the setup process.

* **MySQL**: A relational database management system used for reliable data storage and management.
